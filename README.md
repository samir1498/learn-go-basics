# Readme: Learning Go Basics

This is a simple Go program that covers fundamental concepts of the Go programming language. The code snippets provided in this package serve as a starting point for learning Go basics. The code includes examples of variables, functions, structs, interfaces, arrays, slices, error handling, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the `main.go` file. Run the following command to execute the program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This should print "Hello, World!" and output the results of various Go features.

## Code Overview

### Variables

The code demonstrates different ways of declaring and initializing variables:

```go
var a int = 10
b := "Hello"
c := 10.5
```

### Functions

The `add` function now returns a `float64` and an `error` for better error handling:

```go
result, err := add(10, 20)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Sum:", result)
}
```

### Custom Error Type

A custom error type (`CustomError`) is introduced for more specific error messages:

```go
type CustomError struct {
    message string
}

func (e CustomError) Error() string {
    return e.message
}

// Example usage
customErr := CustomError{"custom error message"}
fmt.Println("Custom Error:", customErr)
```

### Learning Resources

The code is based on the content of the video [Learning Go Programming - Golang Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo&t=11542s). Feel free to refer to the video for more in-depth explanations and hands-on learning.

## Conclusion

This Go program provides a foundation for understanding essential concepts. Experiment with the code, modify it, and explore additional features of the Go programming language to enhance your learning experience.
